			<strong>List of skills, strategies, or tactics you've learned about writing or learning CSS.</strong>

		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  			<li>Defining the different style clearler rather than typing them out separately on the html page.</li>
		<div style="border-spacing:3px">

		<section style="font-family:courier;color:#556C76">
 			<li>The DevTools that was mentioned in the article. Never heard of this tool that could help finding issue when typing CSS, I will definitely try out someday.</li>
 		<div style="border-spacing:3px">
 			<br>
 		<section style="font-family:courier;color:#415F4A">
  			<li>The examples that were shown in the website, I realized that with the stylesheet, we don't even need to type out the font, margin, or sizes...etc on the html page, which again made the html page became clean and simple.</li>
  		<div style="border-spacing:3px">

  		<section style="font-family:courier;color:#556C76">
  			<li>The in or out of flow were also the things that were new to me, yet with the example that were shown, I could easily get the point.</li>

  			<br>	
  		<section style="font-family:courier;color:#415F4A">	
  			<li>Using the cheat sheet was definitely one of the huge main points of the whole learning process. If we constantly rely on the cheat sheet we couldn’t be able to find out the issue when something didn't work.</li>

			<strong>Questions that are left with after reading the article.</strong>

		<br>
		<section style="font-family:courier;color:#415F4A">	
  			<li>Question that I still don’t quite understand will be the layout part, I guess the layout systems are the main issue here, since I wasn’t familiar with them.</li>
  		<div style="border-spacing:3px">	
  			<br>	
  		<section style="font-family:courier;color:#415F4A">	
  			<li>Rather than a question, this is more like a thing for me to explore in the future, which is the fonts and typography. I think it is one of the huge focus that I need to discover, moreover, my page could be gorgeous, but the fonts on the page will take the huge part and focus of the web page. I would like to explore more on the different typography styles and find one that defines me and can tell the personality of myself.</li>

  		<section style="font-family:courier;color:#415F4A">	
  			<li>Also rather than a question this is one of the new things that I’ll try on, the transforms and animations. I’ve seen lots of websites with cool effects or motions, and I’m always curious about the process of creating them. I’ll like to learn and discover more about this part.</li>
