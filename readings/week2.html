				The New York City Map shows the unique parts in different district of New York City. While going through each part of the website, different sounds are presented depending on the places. One specific page I like is the subway page. One person tells his story. The designer of the page uses conversation bubble and let the viewers tap on them to reveal the voice. The web page is new to me, yet resonate my experience when I was in New York last year. The city and people were fresh and odd to me who grew up in a small city speaking my native language.

				I Stand Between presents variety of story background from the adopted Asian American children. Each person expresses their thoughts through audio record that can be played on the web page. There are also photographs and drawings from different people. they shared their stories which brings me lots of comfort and strength. As an international student studying and living in New York all alone, I feel the cultural differences and the environment changes around me. Sometimes things can get tough, but when you open up the mind, things can go through smoothly and you'll learn a lot during the process.

				Trying Trying is definitely an unexpected web page I've ever seen. It is created for meditation, relaxation. The infinite flipping color board alone with the sound effect create some sort of hypnosis feeling. Personally, web page like this I've never seen before, but I've heard people talking about them. It might be one way for the people who want to try out different methods of releasing stress, especially nowadays. However, to me this isn't quite a pleasing way for relaxation, I feel a bit uncomfortable while looking at the screen keeps on changing the color. The sound effect also makes me has goosebump. I'll rather choose another way for meditation.
