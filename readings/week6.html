			The examples that are shown in the article gave me lots of new ideas that could be taken into consideration in my creative process of the making of the webpage. We people often work inside the limited state of mind, lock our creative mindsets inside the boxes without challenging or taking a little risk to step outside of the box. How the example of Hockney’s art projects really blew my mind. We used to think of art work should be filled up the edges of the canvas which we considered them as a basic rule of creating art. But in this case Chimero was suggesting us that we as creators shouldn’t just limit ourselves inside the border. What we often use the internet as a blank page and work on it, instead, we should take it as a material to build on. When we started with a web design, we thought of the banners should be placed on top, bottoms should be listed organize, borders should be next to each other or on top of one another...etc. Yet, we never really develop other more creative ways to build the page. For instance the collage work we did with teared up magazine pages or newspapers, it could be taken into consideration when we created a web page, rather than thinking of it as a sheet that should be well organized, how about a collage work that things could be placed randomly? Chimero end with questions for his audience to take along while building a creative webpage: What is the role of technology in your life? What do you expect it to bring you? I thought of these questions for a great afternoon while doing my collage work. What I came up with were that, technology took a serious part of my life. Furthermore, me born with the gift of the rapid development of technology, it really was part of me to be more specific. Using the internet as a social community platform, as a relaxation, as an information center… many more things I received from the technology. Most importantly it brought me some inspiration when creating work. What I expected and wish to reflect on my work from the technology is a unique platform or space that people or even myself can absorb or learn when scrolling the web pages.
