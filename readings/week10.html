			Nonlinear narratives provides audience option to choose rather than things or events that has already been set in a specific way. Personally thinking nonlinear narrative will be best use in game design. Since audience have the power to have their own option, when designing games designer can just provide the choices, and the audience elaborate their own plots and the ending of the story. Hypertext and hypermedia connect to the nonlinear narrative by having the net users to go into one webpage and extended out to other pages. For example, Wikipedia always provides various links within the information as well as the resources. When the audience wanted to learn more about the specific vocabulary or events, they could simply go into the links Wikipedia provided, and therefore finding more details and information about the items the audience have interests in.
