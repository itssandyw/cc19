  			<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing communication methods for limited audiences? This can address the use, misuse, or lack of use of written language, technology, or visual design as forms of communication.</li>
  			<br>
					In the interview between Delaney and Butler, they talked about how pictorial languages are invented for people who couldn’t read. The system helped these people created a method of an easier way to learn the language rather than forcing them to learn and study like we usually do. If they did, they might have a huge gap between the other people in the society, due to the delaying of learning language, they couldn’t catch up with the others. Nevertheless, people who learned pictorial languages might have more creativity thoughts, that could also be a skill they own that helped them in the different fields of learning, producing, or creating process. However, these people also had possibility that there would be  a small gap with the communication and connection with people. Not saying that they couldn’t talk, is the differences between the learning method could build a misunderstanding with people. On the other hand, these people who couldn’t read they still got other platform for them to express such as visual art or creative writing on the internet. They could share with the public what their language looked like on various stages and platforms.

 			<li>As so-called “digital natives”, where do you see literacy (of language, image, culture, tech, etc.) valued and/or devalued on the Web or amongst users of the Web? Are there notable advantages or disadvantages of any perceived shifts in recent years?</li>
 			<br>
 					As a small part of the digital natives, compared to the most recent digital natives kids, I’ll say that the devalued of the Web is much more obvious than valued it. When I first access with the web, I remembered it was my uncle trying to play video of the cartoon Sleeping Beauty that I’ve read a lot before. He wanted to show me how the animation was created and also as a reward of me getting a good grade on my English exam. I still remembered the moment when I saw the princess on the screen, I screamed with happiness. After that I started to learn how to use the computer to search for the problem that I wanted to solve. The most recent generation, their mom and dad used the Web for keeping their kids quite, of course not all the parents did that, but it was slowly becoming an issue. Kids got impatient and fierce easily when they didn’t receive the things they want. The use of Web in the early days were more about finding the truth or learning knowledge, of course sometimes for entertainment and relaxation. Now the Web were expanded for many other uses such as gaming or documenting. The great use of documenting such as blog or video taking and uploading online (a.k.a vlog). People used these platforms to document their lives as well as sharing some experience with the world. However, here came with the problem that everyone wanted to become internet popular and basically copy other people’s style. This made the Web become less valuable.

  			<li>How do you see the expanding or limiting nature of hypertext on today's Web? Do Delany's criticisms of hypertext still hold true within the modern Web and all of its growth and advancements?</li>
  			<br>
  					Delany’s idea and criticisms for hypertext still hold half truth in today’s Web. Delany preferred a physical interaction with the books and the places people went, which I’ll say I sometimes prefer this idea as well. I found out that reading a physical copy of an essay gave me more productivity and the desire to read. Same to taking notes, I also prefer handwritten notes compared to typing on the computer. Through the advance of the technology and the complexity of the society growth, people would go online and search for the materials they need, instead of going to a library, even I did that too. There were also people hiding behind the screen and limited themselves from walking in the nature. Like Delany said, galleries on the Web allowed people to just click through the images through the screen. Yet an interactive art should be people visit the gallery and experience the space and walk through the work in person. Through they growth of the Web, however, there were also people found places or locations they were longing for, they worked hard and save their allowance for traveling to these places. As a result, the Web could also be an encouragement for people to work harder to earn what they desired.

  			<li>Are there any technological or societal speculations mentioned in this conversation that have come to be realized in the 11 years since these statements were made? Any that you see as irrelevant?</li>
  			<br>
  					Personally, many of the societal speculations mentioned were happening right now, one that’s most obvious and people should reflect on is the identity. Many people hide their identity or change to their ideal identity in cyberspace. These people mostly had less self confidence. I wouldn’t lie, I’m also part of them. In this society, where women and men were given pretty high standards and stereotypes, our social values are getting more complex. Therefore, in real life people do plastic surgery to fulfill or achieve these standards. Nonetheless, we can also see lots of pictures on social media that had been filtered or photoshopped that look unfamiliar to the real person. These are all because of those standards we’re expecting or dreaming of. There’s also people hidden behind the screen and created an ideal identity in the gaming world. They would use these fake identity to defraud other characters in the cyberspace. This is the most common societal speculation that happened in my country. People often been defrauded with a thousand dollar. Most people are self conscious about their true identity often escape from reality and create their ideal self identity in cyberspace.

  			<li>How do you practice primitive hypertext?</li>
  			<br>
  					Personally, most people might have the same way to practice primitive hypertext. For example, I like to walk around with my headphones one and just simply walking without any destination. In the middle of walking, I see something interesting, I stop and observe for a while, take a picture, then I keep walking. For the rest of the day I might just be thinking about the thing I saw. Why will the object or event happen to exist at this place and what kind of people will be as interesting as I do? I also like to sit at a place and just observe people walking pass by, and just be thinking, “wow! He/she has a really unique style.” Or as simple as, “ where are they going?” I think giving myself a time to worry about work, and just think about the most basic question is my way of practicing primitive hypertext.
